  "prediction": "Based on the analysis, the trading outlook is as follows:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is showing a bearish trend with a high confidence of 70%, while Ethereum (ETH) trend is bullish with a confidence of 50%. The current trend alignment is divergent with a reversal alert.\n\nThe weighted bias analysis suggests a neutral stand. The order book strength is at 66.1%, liquidation strength at 50%, and volatility strength at 25%. There is no crowding detected in the real-time crowding check.\n\nThe adaptive risk management indicates no significant risk with ATR spike and opposite movement both being negative. The multi-timeframe confirmation is also neutral with no changes in confidence.\n\nThe overall confidence is 62% based on the signals from the order book, volume, RSI, and liquidation. There is a slight adjustment due to alignment resulting in a final confidence of 57%.\n\nAs per the decision framework, the outlook remains neutral with a position size of 100%. \n\nThis implies that traders should maintain a balanced portfolio without heavily leaning towards either buying or selling. It's recommended to closely monitor the market for any significant changes, given the divergence in the trends of BTC and ETH.",
