SHORT-TERM PROGNOSIS (next 24-48 hours):\nBased on the technical indicators, funding rates, and market sentiment, the short-term prognosis for BTC and ETH is as follows:\n- BTC: The RSI is in overbought territory, indicating a potential pullback. The funding rate is slightly high, suggesting a bearish sentiment. Market sentiment is neutral to slightly bearish.\n- ETH: The RSI is also in overbought territory, signaling a possible correction. The funding rate is negative, indicating a bearish sentiment. Market sentiment is bearish.\n\n2. BUY/SELL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- BTC: Based on the technical indicators and market sentiment, it is recommended to consider selling BTC in the short term due to the overbought RSI and bearish funding rate.\n- ETH: Similarly, it is advisable to consider selling ETH in the short term due to the overbought RSI, negative funding rate, and bearish market sentiment.\n\n3. MACROECONOMIC IMPACT:\nExpanding M2 money supply is generally bullish for crypto prices as it increases liquidity in the market. In the current context, with a high M2 money supply, moderate inflation rates, and elevated interest rates, the impact on crypto prices is likely neutral to slightly bearish due to potential concerns about rising interest rates affecting risk assets.\n\n4. MARKET STRUCTURE:\nCrypto, stocks, and commodities are currently moving in different directions. While crypto prices are showing signs of a potential correction, stocks are trading at high levels, and commodities are relatively stable.\n\n5. RISK ASSESSMENT:\nThe current market risk level is moderate to high, around 7-8 on a scale of 1-10. The overbought conditions in the crypto market, along with potential macroeconomic headwinds from interest rate hikes, pose significant risks for investors.\n\nOverall, it is recommended to exercise caution in the current market environment and consider reducing exposure to crypto assets in the short term. Keep a close eye on technical indicators, funding rates, and macroeconomic developments for timely adjustments to your trading strategy.",

        "prediction": "1. SHORT-TERM PROGNOSIS (next 24-48 hours):\nBased on the technical indicators, funding rates, and market sentiment, the short-term prognosis for BTC and ETH is bullish. Both BTC and ETH have bullish trends, with BTC showing a neutral signal and ETH showing a strong sell signal. The funding rates for BTC and ETH are relatively low, indicating a lack of extreme leverage in the market. The Fear & Greed index is at 74, indicating a sentiment of greed but not extreme greed. Therefore, in the next 24-48 hours, we can expect BTC and ETH prices to continue their upward trend.\n\n2. BUY/SELL RECOMMENDATIONS:\nBased on the current data, I would recommend buying BTC and ETH. BTC is showing a bullish trend with a neutral signal, indicating a potential for further upside. ETH, despite showing a strong sell signal, has been performing well and could see a reversal in the short term. Therefore, it might be a good opportunity to accumulate ETH at current levels.\n\n3. MACROECONOMIC IMPACT:\nIn the current context, an expanding M2 money supply is likely bullish for crypto prices. With a high M2 money supply, investors may seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The inflation rate of 2.31% is relatively moderate, and the Fed rate and 10Y Treasury rate are also at reasonable levels, providing a supportive macroeconomic environment for crypto assets.\n\n4. MARKET STRUCTURE:\nCrypto, stocks, and commodities are currently moving in a mixed manner. While crypto prices are on an upward trend, the stock market is also performing well, with indices like S&P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ at high levels. Commodities like gold, silver, and crude oil are relatively stable. Overall, there is a positive sentiment in the financial markets, which is reflected in the performance of various asset classes.\n\n5. RISK ASSESSMENT:\nOn a scale of 1-10, the current market risk level is around 6. While the overall sentiment is positive, there are risks associated with high RSI levels for BTC and ETH, indicating potential overbought conditions. Additionally, geopolitical events, regulatory changes, or unexpected market developments could introduce volatility and increase risk levels in the short term. Investors should closely monitor these factors to manage their risk exposure effectively.",

SHORT-TERM PROGNOSIS (next 24-48 hours):\nBased on the technical indicators, funding rates, and market sentiment, the short-term prognosis for BTC and ETH is as follows:\n\n- BTC: The technical indicators show a bullish trend with a high RSI of 75.75, indicating overbought conditions. The funding rate has increased to 0.0097%, suggesting increased leverage in the market. The overall sentiment is still positive, but caution is advised due to the overbought RSI. A short-term correction or consolidation phase could be expected.\n\n- ETH: Similar to BTC, ETH is also in a bullish trend with a high RSI of 77.21. The funding rate is slightly lower at 0.0089%. The strong sell signal indicates a potential reversal in price. Traders should be cautious as ETH may experience a pullback in the short term.\n\n2. BUY/SELL RECOMMENDATIONS:\nBased on the current market conditions, the following recommendations are provided:\n\n- BTC: It is recommended to consider taking profits or reducing exposure to BTC due to the overbought RSI and sell signal. Traders may look for opportunities to enter at lower levels after a potential correction.\n\n- ETH: A sell recommendation is advised for ETH as the strong sell signal and high RSI indicate a possible reversal. Traders should monitor the price action closely and consider taking profits or reducing positions.\n\n3. MACROECONOMIC IMPACT:\n- Expanding M2 money supply is generally bullish for crypto prices as it increases liquidity in the market. However, the current inflation rate and interest rates may lead to concerns about potential tightening by the Federal Reserve, which could impact risk appetite in the market.\n\n4. MARKET STRUCTURE:\nCrypto, stocks, and commodities are currently moving in a mixed direction. While crypto prices have been bullish, stocks are relatively stable, and commodities are showing some volatility. It is essential to monitor the interplay between these asset classes for broader market trends.\n\n5. RISK ASSESSMENT:\nThe current market risk level is moderately high, with a risk rating of 7 out of 10. The overbought conditions in BTC and ETH, coupled with potential macroeconomic uncertainties, suggest a cautious approach to trading in the short term.\n\nOverall, traders should exercise caution and closely monitor the market dynamics for potential opportunities and risks. It is essential to stay informed about both technical and fundamental factors influencing the market to make well-informed trading decisions.",

However, the technical signals for both assets are mixed, with a neutral signal for BTC and a strong sell signal for ETH. The Fear & Greed index indicates a sentiment of greed but not extreme levels. The market direction appears to be bullish but with some caution due to the mixed signals.\n\n2. ACTIONABLE TRADING RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- For BTC:\n   - LONG entry: $107,000\n   - STOP-LOSS: $105,500\n   - TAKE PROFIT: $110,000\n   - Confidence: 7/10 - Bullish trend but mixed signals\n- For ETH:\n   - SHORT entry: $2,550\n   - STOP-LOSS: $2,600\n   - TAKE PROFIT: $2,400\n   - Confidence: 6/10 - Strong sell signal but bullish trend\n\n3. MACROECONOMIC IMPACT:\nThe expanding M2 money supply is generally bullish for crypto prices as it increases liquidity in the market. However, inflation rates and interest rates at current levels are not significantly impacting crypto prices. In this context, the expanding M2 supply is bullish for crypto.\n\n4. MARKET STRUCTURE:\nCrypto, stocks, and commodities are showing some divergence in movement. While crypto assets are in a bullish trend, stocks are relatively stable, and commodities are mixed. This divergence suggests that crypto may be positioned for further gains independently of traditional markets.\n\n5. RISK ASSESSMENT & TIMEFRAME:\n- Current market risk level: 6/10\n- Expected timeframe: Days\n- Specific market events or indicators that could invalidate predictions: Major regulatory announcements, unexpected macroeconomic shifts, or large market sell-offs.\n\nOverall, the crypto market is showing bullish tendencies, but caution is advised due to mixed technical signals and potential market risks. Traders should closely monitor key price levels and market developments to adjust their positions accordingly.",
